## The problem

You want to display an image in your React Native app that fills the width of
its container and scales its height according to the aspect ratio of the image.
If you're coming from front-end web development, you may be familiar with
Bootstrap 3's `img-responsive` class or manually applying `max-width: 100%` and
`height: auto` to an image. Unfortunately, `auto` is not a valid value for
`height` in React Native, so that technique doesn't quite translate.

## This solution

This calculates the aspect ratio of your image for you (or uses a fixed value,
if you supply one) and provides you with the appropriate props to apply to a
`View` container and an `Image` inside it which will produce the results you're
looking for. The secret sauce is setting both the `height` and `width`
attributes of the `style` prop on the `Image` to `100%` and wrapping it with a
`View` that has its [`aspectRatio`][aspectratio] style property set to match the
aspect ratio you want. The package provides both a [render prop
component][render-props] and a [custom hook][hooks-intro].

## Installation

Using [yarn][yarn]:

```shell
yarn add react-native-responsive-image-view
```

Or, [npm][npm]:

```shell
npm install react-native-responsive-image-view
```

> This package also depends on `react`, `prop-types`, and `react-native`. Please
> make sure you have those installed as well.

## Usage

As mentioned above, this package includes both a render prop component (the
default export) and a custom hook (a named export). They provide the same
functionality, so choose whichever is most appropriate for your project.

### Component

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View } from 'react-native';
import ResponsiveImageView from 'react-native-responsive-image-view';

export default ({ imageUri }) => (
  <ResponsiveImageView source={{ uri: imageUri }}>
    {({ getViewProps, getImageProps }) => (
      <View {...getViewProps()}>
        <Image {...getImageProps()} />
      </View>
    )}
  </ResponsiveImageView>
);
```

**N.B.** This component doesn't render anything itself, it just calls your
render function or injected component and renders that. ["Use a render
prop!"][use-a-render-prop] Just be sure to render the `Image` inside the `View`
in your `render` function.

> In addition to a literal `render` prop, it also supports the component
> injection and function-as-children patterns if you prefer. See the
> [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function) section for details.

### Hook

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View } from 'react-native';
import { useResponsiveImageView } from 'react-native-responsive-image-view';

export default ({ imageUri }) => {
  const { getViewProps, getImageProps } = useResponsiveImageView({
    source: { uri: imageUri },
  });

  return (
    <View {...getViewProps()}>
      <Image {...getImageProps()} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Input

The component takes its inputs as individual props, while the hook takes its
inputs as an object (the only parameter), but the inputs themselves are
primarily the same:

### Basic Inputs

#### onLoad

> `function()` | optional, no useful default

Called after the image has been loaded (and the aspect ratio has been
calculated).

#### onError

> `function(error: string)` | optional, no useful default

Called if the image could not be loaded. Called with the error message in the
form of a string.

- `error`: the error message as a string

#### source

> `number`/`object` | _required_

The source for your `Image`. This can be a local file resource (the result of an
`import` or `require` statement) or an object containing a `uri` key with a
remote URL as its value.

### Advanced Inputs

#### aspectRatio

> `number` | **control prop**, default: automatically calculated from image
> dimensions

By default, `react-native-responsive-image-view` manages this value internally
based on the dimensions of the source image. However, if more control is needed,
you can pass in a fixed aspect ratio to use instead. This is useful if you want
to fit the image into a statically shaped box such as a navigation drawer
header.

### Component-only Inputs

#### Render Prop Function

This is where you render whatever you want to based on the state of
`react-native-responsive-image-view` when using the component (not applicable
when using the hook). It's just a function or component, available in a few
different ways. Read Donavon West's very opinionated but informative [post about
them][faccs-and-ci] for more information. They all receive the same props, so it
is purely a stylistic choice left up to you as the consumer.

```jsx
// component injection
<ResponsiveImageView component={/* right here */} />

// render prop
<ResponsiveImageView render={/* right here */} />

// function-as-children
<ResponsiveImageView>
  {/* right here */}
</ResponsiveImageView>
```

Choose your approach by passing one of the following props:

##### component

> `component` | _optional_

This is rendered with an object passed in as `props`. Read more about the
properties of this object in the [Output](#output) section.

##### render

> `function({})` | _optional_

This is called with an object. Read more about the properties of this object in
the [Output](#output) section.

##### children

> `function({})` | _optional_

This is called with an object. Read more about the properties of this object in
the [Output](#output) section.

**N.B.** Multiple render methods should not be combined, but in the event that
they are, `react-native-responsive-image-view` will honor the following order:

1.  `component`
1.  `render`
1.  function as `children`
1.  non-functional `children` (render children normally)
1.  `null` (render nothing)

## Output

Regardless of whether you are using the component or the hook, the results are
an object containing important properties you'll need for rendering. It will be
passed to the [Render Prop Function](#render-prop-function) when using the
component, and returned from the hook invocation when using the hook. The
properties of this object can be split into two categories as indicated below:

### prop getters

> See [this blog post about prop getters][kent-prop-getters]

These functions are used to apply props to the elements that you render. This
gives you maximum flexibility to render what, when, and wherever you like. You
call these on the element in question (for example:
`<View {...getViewProps()}`)). It's advisable to pass all your props to that
function rather than applying them on the element yourself to avoid your props
being overridden (or overriding the props returned). For example:
`getViewProps({ hitSlop: myHitSlop })`.

| property        | type           | description                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getViewProps`  | `function({})` | returns the props you should apply to the `View` (parent of `Image`) you render |
| `getImageProps` | `function({})` | returns the props you should apply to the `Image` (child of `View`) you render  |

#### `getViewProps`

This method should be applied to the `View` you render. It is recommended that
you pass all props as an object to this method which will compose together any
of the props you need to apply to the `View` while preserving the ones that
`react-native-responsive-image-view` needs to apply to make the `View` behave.

There are no required properties for this method.

#### `getImageProps`

This method should be applied to the `Image` you render. It is recommended that
you pass all props as an object to this method which will compose together any
of the props you need to apply to the `Image` while preserving the ones that
`react-native-responsive-image-view` needs to apply to make the `Image` behave.

There are no required properties for this method.

### state

These are values that represent the current state of the component.

| property  | type      | description                                                    |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loading` | `boolean` | whether or not the image is currently loading                  |
| `error`   | `string`  | an error message if the image failed to load (`''` on success) |

## Examples

See the [`examples`][examples-directory] directory for examples using both the
component and the hook.

## Snack Playground

Check out the [Snack Playground][snack-playground] for an interactive experience
where you can try out the various usage patterns. You can see the code run live
on your own device via the [Expo client][expo-client], or enable the Preview
option to use the in-browser simulators!

## Inspiration

I was heavily inspired by [`react-native-flex-image`][react-native-flex-image]
from [KodeFox][kodefox] (see the [Other Solutions](#other-solutions) section)
with regards to how to display the image to get the desired behavior. The
original implementation and API were primarily inspired by [Michael
Jackson][mjackson]'s ["Use a Render Prop!"][use-a-render-prop] post and video,
as well as [Kent C. Dodds][kentcdodds]' [introduction to prop
getters][kent-prop-getters].

## Other Solutions

After scouring [npm][npm] for solutions and trying most (if not all) of them,
the best option I found was the following:

- [`react-native-flex-image`][react-native-flex-image]

Unfortunately, it is too restrictive for my use cases. It renders the magic
`<View><Image /></View>` combination for you, preventing you from customizing
the layout. For example, it provides an `onPress` prop if you want to make the
`Image` touchable, but it wraps the `Image` in a `TouchableOpacity` (what if I
wanted a `TouchableHighlight` instead?). It also renders its own loading
indicator (an `ActivityIndicator`) as well as error messages (as `Text`). At the
end of the day, these features proved to be too opinionated.
